# This script configures an Ubuntu server as follows:
# - localhost resolves to 127.0.0.2
# - facebook.com resolves to 8.8.8.8

# Backup the original hosts file
sudo cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.backup

# Write the new entries to the hosts file
echo -e "127.0.0.2\tlocalhost" | sudo tee /etc/hosts > /dev/null
echo -e "8.8.8.8\tfacebook.com" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts > /dev/null

# The -e flag enables interpretation of backslash escapes
# \t inserts a tab space
# tee command is used to write to the file as sudo
# tee -a appends to the file instead of overwriting it
